/**
 * Builds per-page metadata without losing the site-wide defaults.
 *
 * Next merges `metadata` **shallowly, per top-level key** — a page that exports
 * its own `openGraph` object replaces the root layout's entirely, silently
 * dropping `siteName`, `locale`, `type`, and `images`. Same for `twitter` and
 * its `card`. So every page-level card has to restate them, and this is the one
 * place that does it.
 *
 * `images` is optional: a segment that ships its own `opengraph-image` file
 * (`/events`, `/e/[slug]`) gets wired up automatically and should omit it.
 * Segments relying on the root card must pass it explicitly — file-convention
 * images resolved at an ancestor segment are overwritten by the page's
 * `openGraph` just like every other key.
